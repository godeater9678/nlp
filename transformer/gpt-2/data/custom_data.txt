Once upon a time, there lived a rabbit and a turtle. The rabbit was very fast, while the turtle was very slow. One day, the rabbit mocked the turtle, calling it slow and boasting that it was the fastest runner. Provoked by the rabbit’s arrogance, the turtle suggested a running race. As the race began, the rabbit saw that the turtle was far behind and felt confident, so it decided to take a nap midway. However, the rabbit ended up sleeping for too long, and the turtle eventually passed by. When the rabbit suddenly woke up, it realized the turtle had overtaken it. Although the rabbit hurried to catch up, the race ended with the turtle’s victory. This story carries the moral lesson that “slow and steady wins the race.” Through this lesson, we are reminded of the importance of living a diligent and meaningful life, avoiding idleness.

Thus, the story of the rabbit and the turtle is an old fable with a moral lesson. The rabbit symbolizes a smart but lazy and arrogant person, while the turtle represents a less intelligent but humble and diligent individual. This story is often used for discussions in elementary school classes. However, in Western interpretations, there are cases where the turtle is seen as unfair because it continued to run even after seeing the rabbit asleep, which makes the turtle appear worse. In this perspective, the rabbit is portrayed as foolish or bad, while the diligent and hardworking turtle becomes the virtuous protagonist.
